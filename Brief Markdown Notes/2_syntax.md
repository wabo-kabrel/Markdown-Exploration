            Basic Syntax
1. Headings  
|-----------------------|  
|   HTML    |  Markdown |  
|-----------------------|  
|   H1      |   #       |  
|   H2      |   ##      |  
|   H3      |   ###     |  
|   H4      |   ####    |  
|   H5      |   #####   |  
|   H6      |   ######  |  
|-----------------------|  
  
Best Practice: Use only one H1(represented by #) per document, and maintain hierarchy (don't skip any level).


2. Paragraphs and Line Breaks
This is a paragraph. To create a new paragraph, leave a blank line.

This is another paragraph.

To create a line break without a new paragraph,  
add two spaces at the end of the line.
  
  
3. Emphasis
   - Italic - Place text in between * * OR _ _
   - Bold   - Place text in between ** **  OR __ __
   - bold and italic - Place text in between *** *** OR ___ ___
   - Strikethrough - Place text in between ~~ ~~
     
Example:  
*Hello* or _Hello World_  
**Hello World** or __Hello World__  
***Hello World*** or ___Hello___  
~~Hello World~~
